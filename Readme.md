## Aerospace Structure Manufacturing Process Optimization
### Project Overview

This project delves into optimizing the manufacturing process of aerospace structures, specifically focusing on the co-curing method used to create honeycomb sandwich structures. We aim to understand and minimize defects, like porosity and poorly formed adhesive fillets, in the final product.

### Approach

Our approach involves a detailed analysis of the co-curing process, identifying key parameters and their interactions. We use advanced models and simulation tools to predict and optimize the facesheet consolidation level and bond-line porosity. Additionally, real-time visualization methods are employed for direct observation and further refinement of the process.

### Objectives

The main goals are to design new cure cycles, enhance manufacturing efficiency, and reduce defects, ultimately leading to improved aerospace structures.
