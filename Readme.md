# Composite Manufacturing Project

## Overview
This repository contains the work and findings of a project focused on composite manufacturing. It includes datasets, modeling scripts, optimization notebooks, and a detailed problem statement.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to explore and optimize the manufacturing processes of composite materials. By analyzing various datasets and employing machine learning models, the project aims to identify key factors that influence the quality and efficiency of composite manufacturing. We use advanced models and simulation tools to predict and optimize the facesheet consolidation level and bond-line porosity. The main goals are to design new cure cycles, enhance manufacturing efficiency, and reduce defects, ultimately leading to improved aerospace structures.
